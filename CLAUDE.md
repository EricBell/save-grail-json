# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**save-grail-json** is a tool to save grail JSON docs to a database for later review and analysis.

This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPL-3.0), which means all derivative works must also be open source under GPL-3.0.

## Project Status

This is a new project in early development. Source code, dependencies, and build configuration have not yet been implemented.

## Development Commands

To be documented once the project structure is established. Typical commands will include:
- Installation/setup
- Running tests
- Linting/formatting
- Building/deploying

## Architecture

The codebase architecture will be documented here as the project develops. Initial planning suggests this will be a Python-based tool for:
- Fetching/receiving grail JSON documentation
- Storing the data in a database
- Providing retrieval/analysis capabilities
